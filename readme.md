This is an example on how to report a minimal reproducible example of a bug 
found with CADET or CADET-Process.

Please use `conda env export > environment.yml` or `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to 
create an environment file so that we can recreate your local python environment. 

Please place all required data and code in appropriate folders and ensure paths are local paths.
